		<h2>Frequently Asked Quenstions:</h2>

		<p>Q: Is an all digital system better than a system that uses disks?</p>

		<p>A: Not all of the time. An all digital system is more convenient and less expensive becasue the games don't physically clutter your house and you can just purchase them right from your console. However, that's not to say it's better... Some people prefer consoles that utilize disks and have the physical copies of games because you can easily re-download the game again if your account gets deleted somehow. Also, people like to collect these games.</p>

		<p>Q: Are there any games that are exclusive to certain types of consoles?</p>

		<p>A: Yes there are. All Nintendo related games can only be played on a Nintendo based system that holds the required components to run the games. There are even games exclusive for Playstation and Xbox.</p>

		<p>Q: Will your inventory be expanding soon?</p>

		<p>A: Yes it will. Our goal is to sell EVERY type of video game that exists. Our inventory will soon have systems and games for Atari, Neo-Geo, Sega, and more! We plan to keep on improving no matter what! :)</p>
